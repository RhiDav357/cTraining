# C Training

This README provides intructions for c++ exercises focussed on different data structures. The exercises should be attempted after working through all the exercises from [Chortle C Puzzles](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/cpuzzles/CpuzzlesMain.html) and are designed to be done in order. Example solutions are provided in the Solutions folder. Only look at these solutions after attempting each of the exercises.

## Exercises

### 1. Arrays

Write a program that will:

* Create an array and populate this array with even integers.
* Add three to each of the integers in the array.
* Subtract six from each of the integers in the array.
* Add four to each of the integers in the array.

Print out the array at each stage so you can see the changes. Try to use a different method with respect to arrays and pointers for each of these additions and subtractions.

### 2. Variable Array

Write a program that will take an integer i as a command line argument,then:

* Create an array of length i, polulated with even integers.
* Perform an arithmatic function to each of the integers in that array.
* Print that array.
* Destroy the array.

Use the asert library to perform some error checking.

### 3. Duration

Write a program that will consider durations as having a minute protion and a second portion. Your program will take 2 durations (can be hardcoded) and add these durations together and print out the result. Your program should also be able to round a duration to the nearest minute.

### Complex Numbers

Write a program that will take two complex numbers and:

* Increment one by the other.
* COnjugate one of them to create a new complex number.
* Perform a basic arithmentic fucntion on one of the existing complex numbers.

After each of these steps you should print the result tok screen.

# C++ Training

This README provides intructions for c++ exercises focussed on different data structures. The exercises are designed to be done in order and example solutions are provided in the Solutions folder. Only look at these solutions after attempting each of the exercises.

## Prerequisites

1) Compelted all the exercises from [Chortle C Puzzles](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/cpuzzles/CpuzzlesMain.html).

## Exercises

### 1. Arrays

Write a program that will:

* Create an array and populate this array with even integers.
* Add three to each of the integers in the array.
* Subtract six from each of the integers in the array.
* Add four to each of the integers in the array.

Print out the array at each stage so you can see the changes. Try to use a different method with respect to arrays and pointers for each of these additions and subtractions.

### 2. Variable Array

Write a program that will take an integer i as a command line argument,then:

* Create an array of length i, populated with even integers.
* Perform an arithmatic function to each of the integers in that array.
* Print that array.
* Destroy the array.

Use the assert library to perform some error checking.

### 3. Duration - Structs

Write a program that will consider durations as having a minute portion and a second portion. Your program will take 2 durations (can be hardcoded) and add these durations together and print out the result. Your program should also be able to round a duration to the nearest minute.

### 4. Complex Numbers - Structs

Write a program that will take two complex numbers and:

* Increment one by the other.
* Conjugate one of them to create a new complex number.
* Perform a basic arithmetic function on one of the existing complex numbers.

After each of these steps you should print the result to screen.

### 5. Vector

Create a program that will create a vector, return the size of the vector, get the value at a particular place in the vector and push back on the vector. The output of the program should print out the the vector to screen.

### 6. List

Create a program that will impliment a doubly linked list. You should the following procedures:

* Push front
* Push back
* Pop front
* Insert after node

### 7. Set

Create a program that will create, insert into and print an ordered set. Pay special attention to how it sorts the set when values are added out of order.
